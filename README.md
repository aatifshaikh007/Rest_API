Rest Api:
The Product Catalogue REST API is a Spring Boot-based application designed to manage
and interact with a product catalog. This API allows users to perform various operations such

filtering options, businesses can easily retrieve products based on different criteria like name,
category, and other attributes. Additionally, the API includes functionality for adding product
ratings, providing a complete solution for managing a product catalog.
